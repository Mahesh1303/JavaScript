    <li>0 (UNSENT): The request has not been initialized.</li>
    <li>1 (OPENED): The request has been set up.</li>

    <p>0 (UNSENT):

        The XMLHttpRequest object has been created, but the open() method hasn't been called yet.</p>
    <p>1 (OPENED):

        The open() method has been called. This is the state where you can set request headers and call the send() method to start the request.</p>
    <p>
        2 (HEADERS_RECEIVED):

The send() method has been called, and the headers and status are available. The response headers have been received from the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        3 (LOADING):

        The response body is being received. The data is being downloaded, but it is not yet complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        4 (DONE):

        The request is complete. The entire response has been received. This is the state where you can access the response data.     
    </p>

        The 200 Status Code
        The 200 status code specifically means "OK" and is part of the 2xx category. 
        
    </p>
    <span>
        It indicates that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted by the server, 
        and the requested resource is being returned in the response.
    </span>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Using xhr.status === 200
In the context of XMLHttpRequest, checking xhr.status === 200 ensures that the request was successful and the server returned a valid response.
 <p> check is crucial for confirming that the response data can be used as expected.</p>
